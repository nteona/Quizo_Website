# Quizo_Website
Application ‘Quizo’

Designed a logo: (quizologo.jpg) and added a background(pic.jpg) 

For the logo design, I used Adobe Illustrator, since it can manipulate figures as vectors. For the website design, or the frontend I used HTML,
Bootstrap, CSS and JavaScript. The requirements given are all met, I designed a functional website, which users can register and log in, an 
identifier for the student and the teacher in the registration form. In addition, a teacher is able to add, update and delete a quiz or 
question/answer in a specific quiz. The information to each quiz are displayed in a table in the student_page.php and teacher_page.php. I decided
to let students and teacher to take the quiz, for the students it is an obvious reason, but for the teacher I decided to add this feature since
it can help the teachers see how their quiz looks to the students. I also added the ability for the teachers to get scores, in order to see if they
have given the right answer, or maybe they made a mistake while creating the quiz.
